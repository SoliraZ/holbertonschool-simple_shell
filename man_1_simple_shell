.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

The program
.B simple_shell
is a minimal UNIX command line interpreter that waits for the user to type a command,
executes it, and then displays a prompt again. It supports simple commands with or without arguments.
The shell operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes. If a command is not found,
an error message is displayed, and the prompt is shown again.

.B simple_shell

handles the "end of file" (Ctrl+D) condition by exiting gracefully.
.LP

The shell will continue to run until the user types the
.B exit

command or sends an interrupt signal (Ctrl+C).
.SH OPTIONS

No options are currently supported.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
